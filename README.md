## Why SoulForge?

Every AI coding tool starts blind. The agent reads files, greps around, slowly pieces together what your codebase looks like. You're paying for the agent to figure out what you already know.

SoulForge doesn't work that way. On startup, it builds a **live dependency graph** of your entire codebase. Every file, symbol, import, and export, ranked by importance, enriched with git history, updated in real-time as files change. The agent already knows which files matter, what depends on what, and how far an edit will ripple. It doesn't need to explore. It just starts working.

### How SoulForge saves you 30-50% on API costs & in less time

| | |
|---|---|
| **Live Soul Map** | The agent already knows where every symbol lives, what imports what, and which files are most important. No wasted tokens reading files just to orient itself. |
| **Surgical reads** | Instead of reading entire files, the agent pulls exactly the function or class it needs by name. A 500-line file becomes a 20-line symbol extraction. The Soul Map provides line numbers and signatures, so the agent always knows precisely what to ask for. |
| **Zero-cost compaction** | When conversations get long, SoulForge compacts context by replaying structured state it already tracked (files touched, decisions made, errors hit) without making an LLM call. Other tools spend thousands of tokens summarizing. SoulForge does it for free. |
| **Shared agent cache** | When multiple agents work in parallel, the first one to read a large file caches it. Others get a compact stub with symbol names and line ranges instead of the full content. Hundreds of lines become four. |
| **Mix-and-match models** | You choose which model handles which job. Put Opus on planning, Sonnet on coding, Haiku on search and cleanup. Or use one model for everything. The task router gives you full control. |
| **Prompt caching** | The Soul Map is stable across turns, so it stays cached. On Anthropic, that means the bulk of the system prompt costs a fraction of what it would otherwise. |

## What makes SoulForge different

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Live Soul Map
A SQLite-backed graph of your entire codebase: files, symbols, imports, exports. Ranked by PageRank, enriched with git co-change history, updated in real-time as you edit. The agent knows what's in your project, what depends on what, and where everything lives. Not a static snapshot. It evolves with your code. [Deep dive →](docs/repo-map.md)

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Surgical Reads
The agent doesn't read whole files. It extracts exactly the function, class, or type it needs by name, powered by the Soul Map's symbol index and a 4-tier intelligence chain (LSP → ts-morph → tree-sitter → regex). A 500-line file becomes a 20-line read. Across 30 languages. [Deep dive →](docs/architecture.md)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

### Multi-Agent Dispatch
Parallelize work across explore, code, and web search agents. When one agent reads a large file, others get a compact stub with symbol names and line ranges instead of re-reading the full content. Edit coordination prevents conflicts. [Deep dive →](docs/agent-bus.md)

</td>
<td>

### Zero-Cost Compaction
State extraction runs as the conversation happens: files touched, decisions made, errors hit. All tracked deterministically. When context gets long, it compacts instantly from this pre-built state. No LLM call, no latency, no cost. [Deep dive →](docs/compaction.md)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

### Multi-Tab Coordination
Run multiple sessions side by side with different models and modes per tab. Agents see what other tabs are editing, get warnings on contested files, and git operations coordinate across tabs automatically. [Deep dive →](docs/cross-tab-coordination.md)

</td>
<td>

### Compound Tools
`read` batches multiple files in parallel with surgical symbol extraction. `multi_edit` applies multiple edits to a file atomically (all-or-nothing). `rename_symbol`, `move_symbol`, `rename_file`, `refactor` are compiler-guaranteed and cross-file. `project` auto-detects lint/test/build across 23 ecosystems. [Deep dive →](docs/compound-tools.md)

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### And also

- **Lock-in mode.** Hides agent narration during work, shows only tool activity and the final answer. Toggle via `/lock-in` or config.
- **Embedded Neovim.** Your actual config, plugins, and LSP servers. The AI works through the same editor you use. [Deep dive →](docs/architecture.md)
- **10 providers.** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Ollama, OpenRouter, LLM Gateway, Vercel AI Gateway, Proxy, and any OpenAI-compatible API. [Deep dive →](docs/provider-options.md)
- **Task router.** Assign different models to different jobs. Spark agents (explore/investigate) and ember agents (code edits) can each use different models. You pick what goes where. [Deep dive →](docs/architecture.md)
- **Code execution (Smithy).** Sandboxed code execution via Anthropic's `code_execution` tool. The agent can run Python to process data, do calculations, or batch tool calls programmatically.
- **User steering.** Type while the agent works. Messages queue up and reach the agent at the next step. [Deep dive →](docs/steering.md)
- **Skills & approval gates.** Installable skills for domain-specific work. Destructive actions require confirmation. Auto mode when you want full autonomy.
- **4-tier code intelligence.** LSP → ts-morph → tree-sitter → regex fallback across 30 languages. Dual LSP: Neovim bridge when the editor is open, standalone servers when it's not. [Deep dive →](docs/architecture.md)

## Roadmap

The intelligence layer is being extracted into reusable packages:

- **`@soulforge/intelligence`**: graph intelligence, tools, and agent orchestration as an importable library
- **`@soulforge/mcp`**: expose Soul Map tools as MCP servers for Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or any MCP client
- **`sf --headless`**: shipped. Non-interactive mode for CI/CD, automation, and scripting. [Docs →](docs/headless.md)

**In progress:** MCP support · repo map visualization · GitHub CLI integration · dispatch worktrees · [ACP support](https://agentclientprotocol.com/)

**Planned:** monorepo graph support · benchmarks · orchestrated workflows (planner → TDD → reviewer → security)

---

## Inspirations

- **[Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)**: tree-sitter repo maps with PageRank. SoulForge adds cochange analysis, blast radius, clone detection, and live updates.
- **[Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code)**: enforce behavior with code, not prompts. Our schema validation, pre-commit gates, and auto-enrichment patterns come from this thinking.
- **[Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai)**: the multi-provider abstraction that makes 10 providers possible.
- **[Neovim](https://neovim.io)**: embedded via msgpack-RPC. Your config and muscle memory shouldn't be a compromise.
